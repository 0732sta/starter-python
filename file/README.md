## Reading File 
Reading file is reading from text file that developer create with words or numbers
### Example 1
- create python file [readDNA.py](https://github.com/0732sta/starter-python/blob/master/file/readDNA.py)
- then, create new folder *file* to store reading text file [dna_sequence.txt](https://github.com/0732sta/starter-python/blob/master/file/dna_sequence.txt) and copy all the words
- open cmd
- locate the folder of readDNA.py file
```bash
cd 'yourfolder'
```
- Then, you can see the output from the input that you wrote in readDNA.py
```bash
python readDNA.py
```
- **the output** : shows the dna code

### Example 2
- create python file [read.py](https://github.com/0732sta/starter-python/blob/master/file/read.py)
- then, create new folder *file* to store reading text file [ipsum.txt](https://github.com/0732sta/starter-python/blob/master/file/ipsum.txt) and copy all the words
- open cmd
- locate the folder of read.py file
```bash
cd 'yourfolder'
```
- Then, you can see the output from the input that you wrote in read.py
```bash
python read.py
```
- **the output** :

### Example 3
- create python file [reads.py](https://github.com/0732sta/starter-python/blob/master/file/reads.py)
- then, create new folder *file* to store reading text file [ipsum.txt](https://github.com/0732sta/starter-python/blob/master/file/ipsum.txt) and copy all the words
- open cmd
- locate the folder of read.py file
```bash
cd 'yourfolder'
```
- Then, you can see the output from the input that you wrote in reads.py
```bash
python reads.py
```
- **the output** : shows start from index 50 until next index 100

## Writing File
Writing file is write words or numbers in python file then, in text file will auto fill up words or number
### Example 1
- create python file [write.py](https://github.com/0732sta/starter-python/blob/master/file/write.py)
- create writing file write.txt for show the output
- open cmd
- locate the folder of write.py file
```bash
cd 'yourfolder'
```
- Then, you can see the output from the input that you wrote in write.py
```bash
python write.py
```
- **the output** : shows in [write.txt](https://github.com/0732sta/starter-python/blob/master/file/write.txt)
